function draw_grid_warp(upper_left, bottom_right, warp, num_segments, varargin)
  %DRAW_GRID Visualize a regular grid before and after warping
  %
  % draw_grid(upper_left, bottom_right, warp, num_segments, orig_fig, warp_fig)
  %
  % Given a grid defined by upper_left, bottom_right, and num_segments, this
  % function draws two plots: one into orig_fig representing the untransformed
  % grid, and one into warp_fig representing the grid after the warp function
  % has been applied to it.
  %
  % The grid's boundaries are defined by upper_left and bottom_right, which mark
  % the upper-left and bottom-right corners respectively. The intermediate
  % gridlines are regularly spaced, and their number is determined by
  % num_segments. For example, a num_segments value of 2 will produce a grid
  % that has 4 squares.
